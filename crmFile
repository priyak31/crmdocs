2. to apply custum js in vtiger for custom module.if your edit.js file not present then custumly created it inside <yourmodulename> folder.
   file: [vtiger roots]/layouts/v7/modules/<modulename>/resources/Edit.js

3. if module is existing then path is same no need to create it customly.
    file: [vtiger roots]/layouts/v7/modules/<modulename>/resources/Edit.js

4. system core layout but not handle it customly 
   file: [vtiger roots]/layouts/vlayout/
   
5. your all uitype core files available in layout/vlayout/module/vtiger/uitypes. not use it for custom refer.its system core.
   if u want customly design then custom it path file: [vtiger roots]/layouts/v7/modules/<modulename>/uitypes/<uitypename>.js
   if no file is available there then it will inherit by file: [vtiger roots]/layouts/v7/module/vtiger/uitypes/<uitypename>.js

6. To create custom smarty template relate to Detailvie or Edit view you can 
   copy the file from core files i.e layout/v7/modules/vtiger/DetailViewHeader.tpl and place it in your module path inside layout/v7/<yourmodule> folder.
   it fetch changes that you made in this file.if you not place any file then it will automatically call parent smarty file.
   Note: you need to write include smarty code for include file that you place inside your model otherwise it will not found your tpl file no matters actual file exist or not.
   that include code is {include file="partials/Menubar.tpl"|vtemplate_path:$MODULE}.
